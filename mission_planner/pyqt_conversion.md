# Converting Mission Planner to PyQt6

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for converting the current web-based Multi-Agency Mission Planner to a desktop application using PyQt6.

## Advantages of PyQt6 Over React

1. **Native Desktop Application**: PyQt6 creates standalone desktop applications rather than web apps, potentially increasing security for sensitive government operations.

2. **Offline Capability**: The application can function without an internet connection, which is vital in field operations.

3. **Performance**: Native applications generally offer better performance for resource-intensive tasks like map rendering and data processing.

4. **System Integration**: Better integration with OS-level features like file system access, hardware peripherals, and system notifications.

5. **Deployment**: Simpler deployment as a standalone executable without requiring web servers or browsers.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Structure

```
mission_planner/
├── main.py                 # Application entry point
├── assets/                 # Images, icons, etc.
│   └── logos/              # Agency logos
├── modules/
│   ├── login.py            # Login screen
│   ├── dashboard.py        # Main dashboard
│   ├── mission_planning.py # Mission planning module
│   ├── map_view.py         # Map functionality using PyQtWebEngine or other map libraries
│   ├── communications.py   # Inter-agency communication module
│   ├── resources.py        # Resource management module
│   └── reports.py          # Reporting module
├── utils/
│   ├── database.py         # Database operations
│   ├── auth.py             # Authentication functions
│   └── api.py              # External API connections
└── ui/                     # UI design files (.ui)
```

### 2. Component Mapping

| Web Component | PyQt6 Equivalent |
|---------------|------------------|
| HTML Structure | QMainWindow, QWidgets |
| CSS Styling | QSS (Qt Style Sheets) |
| JS Application Logic | Python code |
| React State Management | PyQt Signals & Slots |
| Leaflet Map | PyQtWebEngine with Leaflet or QGraphicsView |

### 3. Technology Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**: Base programming language
- **PyQt6**: UI framework
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Local/remote database
- **PyQtWebEngine**: For map functionality (or alternative mapping libraries)
- **Requests**: For API calls to external services
- **Paramiko**: For secure SSH connections to government networks
- **Cryptography**: For encryption of sensitive data

### 4. Authentication Implementation

- Implement multi-factor authentication using PyQt6 custom dialogs
- Support for Smart Card/PIV integration using Python PKCS#11 libraries
- Role-based access control using secure storage

### 5. Map Implementation Options

1. **PyQtWebEngine with Leaflet**: Embed the existing Leaflet implementation within a WebEngine widget
2. **QGraphicsView**: Create a custom map implementation using Qt's graphics framework
3. **Third-party options**: Consider integrating libraries like QMapControl or Python bindings for GDAL

### 6. Database Considerations

- SQLite for standalone deployments
- PostgreSQL/MySQL for networked operations
- Encrypted storage for sensitive information
- Synchronization protocols for offline operations

### 7. Development Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Planning | 2 weeks | Detailed design and architecture |
| UI Development | 4 weeks | Building UI components |
| Core Functionality | 6 weeks | Map, communications, planning features |
| Authentication & Security | 3 weeks | Security features implementation |
| Testing & QA | 3 weeks | Unit and integration testing |
| Agency Approval Process | 4 weeks | Security reviews and approvals |
| Deployment | 2 weeks | Packaging and deployment |

## Security Considerations

- All stored data should be encrypted at rest
- Communications between agencies must be encrypted
- Support for government-approved encryption standards
- Detailed audit logging of all system activities
- Network isolation mode for sensitive operations
- End-to-end encryption for inter-agency communications

## Next Steps

1. Create a proof-of-concept with basic login and map functionality
2. Conduct security review with relevant agencies
3. Develop detailed technical specifications
4. Begin phased development with most critical modules first
