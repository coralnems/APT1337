## Technical Details

This application is built as a frontend prototype using:
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- Simulated authentication and communication for demonstration purposes

In a production environment, this would be connected to:
- Secure authentication services
- Backend database for mission data
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- GIS services for advanced mapping features

## Security Notes

This is a prototype application. In a production environment:
- All communications would be encrypted
- User authentication would use strong multi-factor authentication
- Data access would be restricted based on security clearance levels
- All actions would be logged for audit purposes

## Next Steps

Future development would include:
- Mobile applications for field operations
- Integration with existing law enforcement systems
- Advanced analytics for intelligence-driven operations
- Custom deployment options for specific agency requirements
